<b>Project I: Dialog</b>

Dialog is a mobile app that records conversations (more than 2-3 minutes) in a purely visual manner. After each conversation, I ask the person I've spoken with to pick a color and a shape that they identify with, and I rate the conversation myself. Once we've input this information, the app records the date / time of use, shape, color, and rating in a CSV file, which is later used to procedurally generate a short film that visualizes my conversations as colored shapes organized in 3D space.

Dialog will be used to capture and visualize conversations from March 5th, 2018 - March 12th, 2018.
